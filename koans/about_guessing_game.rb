# For this koan, we're using a pre-built class called NumberThinker.
#
# When a NumberThinker is created it's passed a number. The
# NumberThinker generates a random number between 0 and the number it
# is given on creation.
#
# NumberThinker has two important methods:
#
# - #guess(n): Takes a number and returns :correct if n equals the number
# it's thinking of, :high if n > the number, and :low if n is too low.
#
# - #guesses: Returns the number of guesses that have been made.  
#
# You'll implement the NumberGuesser. The NumberGuesser tries to guess
# a number between 0 and max_number in as few guesses as possible,
# based on the result of the previous guesses (:high, :low, :correct).
# 
# Implement NumberGuesser#make_guess so that it guesses a number,
# given the following constraints:
#
# * Don't guess the same number twice
# * Get the number in as few guesses as possible
# * Use the feedback to refine your guess
#
